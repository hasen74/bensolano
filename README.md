## Welcome to My Portfolio Website

This web application was developped with NextJs. It contains an introduction page, a page showing my programming skills through language or software icons, and a page with a list of my projects.

The app features two menus : a navigation menu and a contact/socials menu. My resume can be download through the latter, and a modal window will open on click on the contact icon, allowing the user to open a new Gmail window or copy my email to clipboard.

The app is responsive: the UI adapts to devices with a resolution higher than 992px (laptops), devices with a resolution lower than 600px (phones), and medium-sized devices with resolution included between these two values.

In "phone mode" the menus become hamburger menus for easier navigation.

I hope you enjoy.
